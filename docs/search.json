      "contents": "\nStudents will need to link their rstudio cloud account to github and enable private repos. RSC is good about prompting for when attempting to create a project from a private repo.\nLess obviously, you will need to enable 3rd-party API access from the GH classroom organization. Note that I don’t entirely understand the security implications, rstudio probably should find a way to invite access via the github API rather than requiring carte blanche access.\nGithub classrooms spams the living heck out of you when students accept invites. Sure, you can set up a mail rule, but…\nRemind students to use the class workspace on RSC, not their default workspaces (or they’ll run out of compute..)\n\n\n\n",
